#### Topic
The Development of Empathetic Conversational Systems: Maintain Interdisciplinary Vision and Identify Research Problem

#### Abstract
In the past years, the spread of the epidemic has exacerbated peopleâ€™s psychological pressure. And the world is facing real challenges especially the surge in demand for mental health services, insufficient medical resources, and uneven resource distribution. To address these problems, researchers have investigated main issues on building empathetic conversational systems capable of caring about and supporting humans. In this talk, I would review the development of empathetic conversation systems, especially the revolutionary changes brought by cognitive reasoning. In the meanwhile, I would relate these developments with the interdisciplinary vision for this research field, and explore potential actions that NLP researchers can take to identify research problems from interesting ideas.
